# Introduction

:::caution

As of mid 2020, BDJS script language has been **deprecated**.

:::

Besides using the default script language (i.e **BDScript 2**) to develop Discord bots in the app. **Bot Designer For Discord** also supports developing bots using [JavaScript](https://javascript.com).

In this page and the following sub-pages, you will learn and explore more about BDFD JavaScript.

## What is BDFD JavaScript?
**BDFD JavaScript** *(also referred as BDJS)* is an another script language available in the app which can be used as alternative to BDScript for developing a Discord bot. Unlike BDScript, BDJS executes a JavaScript code. It uses ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) JavaScript version. This script is powered by a JS engine made using [Go](https://go.dev) and is not an actual JavaScript.

BDJS has limited Discord API functions support available.

:::caution

BDFD JavaScript is not recommended to be used by users who aren't familiar with JavaScript language. It's a language which is entirely different from BDScript and without any proper JS knowledge, the user would get confused whether be it in understanding or writing codes.
